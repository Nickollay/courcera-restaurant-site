**Deployed it here on github** 
https://nickollay.github.io/courcera-restaurant-site/site/index.html

It's a study project for coursera course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers

#### For now it needs to be finished.
It has only HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP code. 
So, I'm planing to finish it with some JS code.
